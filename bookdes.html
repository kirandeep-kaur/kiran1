            <p>Shakespeare’s fascinating late work The Winter’s Tale has always defied classification. With elements of tragedy, comedy and romance mingling and running up against one another in an often-complicated story of jealousy, love, vindictiveness and redemption, audiences have never been quite sure how to define this moving, mysterious and ultimately tender creation. A “problem” play it may be, but most people are content to simply accept and cherish it for what it is—a great human drama.

Christopher Wheeldon, in his ballet version of the play, shies away from neither the story’s thematic complexities nor the radical and often conflicting shifts in tone that make it the bold and unique work that it is. Working again with designer Bob Crowley and composer Joby Talbot, the same key creative team who gave us the unforgettable Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Mr. Wheeldon embraces the full range of the play’s emotional life, lavishing some of his most inventive and exuberant choreography to date on the rich and captivating characters that populate Shakespeare’s beguiling narrative.

A ballet alert in every scene to the ambiguities and contradictions that both shape and confound our lives, The Winter’s Tale is a profound and searching drama of love and redemption and the spring that lies beneath even the darkest of days.
